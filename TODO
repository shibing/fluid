rtpslib:
- redo UniformGrid as Domain class (rename particle directory to domain)
- port in gordon's branch
    * opencl functions and source loading method
    - intialization routines and options
    - change to a 2 step method (instead of seperate loops for each calculation)
    - neighbor list cl code
- dynamic addition subtraction of particles in the system (cpp interface, blender, and hooks in the gpu?)
    - active/inactive flag for particles
        - where should checks be? probably want reordering so we can just check i < num_active or something
        - probably need to implement neighborlist stuff first to get better idea

- start framework for opencl support investigation functions (also check for nvidia at runtime so we can do some specific things like custom compiler options)
- cpu implementation of grid-hash method to remove n2 global search (also prepare for z-indexing)
- prepare a CPU only option with #ifdefs (so android can use same source)
    - CPU only should also be a runtime setting...
