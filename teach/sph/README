Execute:
    python main.py

dependencies:
    pygame
    numpy

Files:

    main.py
        loads the pygame window and has the main event loop

    sph.py
        SPH class defines the fluid parameters
        Particle class handles each particles info and has drawing function
        init_particles function and addRect to distribute particles

    forces.py
        routines for calculating density, force and integration updates

    domain.py
        Domain class for handling the physical domain
        will also contain grid functions for optimized neighbor search

    kernels.py
        the various Smoothing Kernels used for the SPH formulations

    vector.py
        Vec class for wrapping numpy.ndarray. gives convenient access to elements like
        v.x and all numpy ufuncs so you can do v3 = np.dot(v1, v2)

    timing.py
        Timer class and print_timing decorator for timing functions
