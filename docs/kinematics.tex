I have a rigid body in a fluid modeled by SPH. What are its equations 
of motion. 

First we start with kinematics. 

I would like the model to rotate with angular speed $\omgvec$, where the 
boldface character represents an axis of rotation. The axis passes
through the point $x_P$.  We will generalize later. Assume this rigid
object is formed from a collection of points $x_i$ that do not move 
relative to each other. In other words: $(x_i-x_j)\cdot(x_k-x_l)$ is 
constant for all time and for all $i,j,k,l$. 

First assume that $\omgvec$ is independent of time (constant angular
velocity and constant axis of rotation).
$$
\vvec_R = \vvec_{cg} + \omgvec \times \rvec_R
$$
where $\vvec_R$ is the velocity of point $R$ on the rigid body, the 
subscript $cg$  denotes center of gravity of the rigid body, 
and $\rvec_R$ is a vector from the center of gravity to the point $R$. 
Now apply this equation to compute the velocity (in the lab frame of 
reference) of particle $S$ on the rigid body: 
$$
\vvec_S = \vvec_{cg} + \omgvec \times \rvec_S
$$
Subtract the two equations: 
$$
\vvec_R-\vvec_S = \omgvec \times (\rvec_R-\rvec_S)
$$
If point $S$ is stationary in the laboratory frame of reference, 
$\vvec_S=0$ and
$$
\vvec_R = \omgvec \times (\rvec_R-\rvec_S) .
$$

To implement this, store the stationary point in a Point3.
and store the rotation vector in another Point3. 

Every iteration, compute the velocity of all the points. Do this on the 
with a GPU kernel: 

computeVel(int num, float4* pos_s, float4 omega, float4 pos_cg)
{
    r = pos_s[index] 
	v = omg x (r - pos_cg)
}
