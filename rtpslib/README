RTPSlib code overview

This is the library code for running OpenCL accelerated Real-Time Particle Systems

Files:

rtpslib/
    RTPS.h + cpp
        The main class of the framework, this is what the user of the library will interact with
    RTPSettings.h + cpp
        The settings class, they systems and their parameters will be configured using this
    structs.h + cpp
        Definitions of some data structures and their helping functions, mostly for interacting with OpenCL
    util.h + cpp
        Utility functions, including some helper functions for VBOs

rtpslib/system/
    System.h + cpp
        The base class for particle systems, defines common functions that the child classes will have to implement.

    Simple.h + cpp
        currently not implemented

    SPH.h + cpp
        The SPH class, initiates all the OpenCL memory, sets up the fluid simulation and provides the update() routine
    sph/
        the .cl files that implement the various routines, as well as corresponding .cpp files that load them
        the .cpp files also have CPU implementations of the routines


rtpslib/particle/
    UniformGrid.h + cpp
        Helper class to setup initial conditions of the system
    In the future more helper classes will be implemented here to allow for dynamically adding particles for example


rtpslib/opencl/
    OpenCL helper classes that wrap the Khronos C++ bindings. 

rtpslib/render/
    OpenGL based classes that provide different rendering functionality. A system will have a renderer assigned to it.
