OUTER.cpp : handles objects defined by point clouds moving inside the 
  fluid. For now these objects are rigid, but that could changed if combined
  with rigging. 

unsorted pos of fluid: not scaled. 
unsorted pos of cloud: not scaled 

permute fluid: do not scale/unscale pos_s 
cloud_permute: scale cloud_pos to simulation space (*0.05)
    cloud_pos_s = 0.05 * cloud_pos_u

Euler: unsorted pos = unsorted pos / scale; // scale=0.05
   p /= scale;

where did we have pos_s *= scale?


What happens if force on boundary cloud particle is cancelled completely 
  (see collision_cloud.cl)


In this folder you can find the implementation of the systems availables in RTPS:
- Simple: used for testing and debugging (created and used by I. Johnson)
- SPH: main system of RTPS, simulates fluids using the SPH formulation (created and maintained by I. Johson, G. Erlebacher, A. Young)
- FLOCK: system that simulates flocking, particles acts like boids (created and maintained by M. Merced)
