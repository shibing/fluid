    ### EnjaParticles in C++ using OpenCL and OpenGL interoperability

rtpslib/
    RTPS: Real-Time Particle Systems
    A framework library for developing particle systems.
    We currently working on support for 
        Simple particle systems
        SPH Fluid simulation
        Boid simulation



    Build:
    see INSTALL file

    Dependencies:
    OpenCL
    OpenGL
    GLEW


    Usage:

    You can execute the test program like:
    cd bin
        ./bin/sph.x
        ./bin/flock.x
        ./bin/multi.x

    The test program has simple mouse interaction:
        Left-Click and drag to rotate the view
        Right-Click and drag to zoom in and out
    and keyboard:
        r - add particles
        h - add hose of particles
        p - print timings of various functions
        w, a, s, d - move around like FPS controls
        t - add in some triangles to collide against


    hit Q or ESC to exit (right now clicking the x on the window will not properly clean up GPU memory...)


cmake/
    cmake modules to help find necessary libraries
